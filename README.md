# PA181

## About
NewlyReused is designed to help you incorporate sustainable practices into your daily life. Every week, we
            present a new challenge that promotes eco-friendly habits, complete with educational content to provide more
            context regarding the challenges’ impact and topic. Use our interactive map or list of places to find nearby
            locations in Brno to fulfill challenges, such as refilling your water bottle. Let's make a big impact
            together by small changes :).
