        <h1>The Impact of Using Water Fountains and Reusable Bottles</h1>
        <p>Switching from single-use plastic water bottles to reusable bottles and using water fountains can have a tremendous positive impact on the environment. Here’s why this small change is so important:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Reduce Plastic Waste</strong><br>
                Single-use plastic water bottles are a major source of plastic pollution. It's estimated that one million plastic bottles are bought every minute globally, and many of these bottles end up in landfills and oceans. By using a reusable bottle, you help reduce this massive plastic waste and its harmful effects on marine life and ecosystems.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Conserve Resources</strong><br>
                Producing plastic water bottles consumes significant resources, including oil, water, and energy. It takes about three liters of water to produce a one-liter plastic bottle. By opting for a reusable bottle, you help conserve these valuable resources and decrease the carbon footprint associated with the production and transportation of bottled water.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Minimize Pollution</strong><br>
                Plastic bottles contribute to pollution when they are improperly disposed of, leading to litter in streets, waterways, and oceans. This pollution harms wildlife and disrupts ecosystems. Reusable bottles help minimize this pollution by reducing the number of plastic bottles that need to be produced and disposed of.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Save Money</strong><br>
                Bottled water is significantly more expensive than tap water. Using a reusable bottle and refilling it at water fountains can save you hundreds of dollars annually. Additionally, many public places now offer free water refill stations, making it convenient to stay hydrated on the go.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong><br>
            Did you know that switching to a reusable water bottle can save you from using approximately 167 single-use bottles per year? Imagine the impact if everyone made this switch!
        </p>
        
        <div class="facts">
            <p><strong>Facts and Statistics:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>91% of plastic is not recycled, ending up in landfills or the environment.</li>
                <li>8 million tons of plastic enter the oceans each year, much of it from single-use bottles.</li>
                <li>The average American uses 167 disposable water bottles annually but only recycles 38.</li>
                <li>Using a reusable bottle can prevent the use of over 1,460 plastic bottles in five years.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Switching to a reusable water bottle and using water fountains is a simple yet impactful way to reduce waste, conserve resources, and minimize pollution. So next time you’re thirsty, refill your reusable bottle at a water fountain. Your small action can lead to big environmental benefits!</p>
