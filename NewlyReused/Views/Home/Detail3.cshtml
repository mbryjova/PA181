        <h1>The Impact of Using Reusable Coffee Cups</h1>
        <p>Ditching single-use coffee cups in favor of reusable ones might seem like a small change, but it has a significant positive impact on the environment. Here’s why making the switch is a smart and sustainable choice:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Reduce Waste</strong><br>
                Single-use coffee cups are a major source of waste. Globally, it's estimated that over 500 billion disposable coffee cups are discarded each year. These cups are typically lined with plastic, making them difficult to recycle and contributing to overflowing landfills.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Save Resources</strong><br>
                Producing single-use cups consumes vast amounts of resources. Each paper cup requires about 20 grams of wood, 2 grams of plastic, and significant amounts of water and energy. By using a reusable cup, you help conserve these valuable resources.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Minimize Pollution</strong><br>
                The production and disposal of single-use cups contribute to pollution. Plastic waste from these cups often ends up in oceans, harming marine life and ecosystems. A reusable cup significantly cuts down on this plastic pollution, promoting a healthier planet.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cost Savings</strong><br>
                Many coffee shops offer discounts when you bring your own reusable cup. Over time, these savings can add up, making it a financially savvy choice. Plus, reusable cups are designed to be durable and stylish, often featuring customizable designs.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong><br>
            Did you know that if just one person uses a reusable cup instead of a disposable one for a year, they can prevent the waste of over 300 cups? Imagine the impact if we all made this small change!
        </p>
